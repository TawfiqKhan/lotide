# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

**Install it:**

`npm install @web-coder/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@username/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `middle(arr)`: Takes an array of numbers and returns the middle value of the Array.
* `head(arr)`: Returns only the Head (arr[0]) section of the Array.
* `tail(arr)`: return all the element of the array except the first element.
